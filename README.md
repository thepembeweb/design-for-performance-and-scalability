# Design for Performance and Scalability

> This project demonstrates how to plan, design, provision, and monitor infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools. It involves using different skills to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance. The project also showcases the use of Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.

## Project  Details


### Task 1: Create AWS Architecture Schematics

#### Part 1
You have been asked to plan and provision a cost-effective AWS infrastructure for a new social media application development project for 50,000 single-region users. The project requires the following AWS infrastructure and services. Please include your name and label all elements of the infrastructure on the diagram.

* Infrastructure in the following regions: us-east-1
* Users and Client machines
* One VPC
* Two Availability Zones
* Four Subnets (2 Public, 2 Private)
* A NAT Gateway
* A CloudFront distribution with an S3 bucket
* Web servers in the Public Subnets sized according to your usage estimates
* Application Servers in the Private Subnets sized according to your usage estimates
* DB Servers in the Private Subnets
* Web Servers Load Balanced and Autoscaled
* Application Servers Load Balanced and Autoscaled
* A Master DB in AZ1 with a read replica in AZ2

Use LucidChart or a similar diagramming application to create your schematic. Export your schematic as a PDF and save as Udacity_Diagram_1.pdf.

#### Part 2
You have been asked to plan a SERVERLESS architecture schematic for a new application development project. The project requires the following AWS infrastructure and services.

* A user and client machine
* AWS Route 53
* A CloudFront Distribution
* AWS Cognito
* AWS Lambda
* API Gateway
* DynamoDB
* S3 Storage

Export your schematic as a PDF and save as Udacity_Diagram_2.pdf


### Task 2: Calculate Infrastructure Costs

#### Part 1
Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate how much it will cost to run the services in your Part 1 diagram for one month.

* Target a monthly estimate between $8,000-$10,000.
* Be mindful of AWS regions when you are estimating costs.
* Export the estimate as a CSV file named Initial_Cost_Estimate.csv.

#### Part 2
Return to the AWS Pricing Calculator and reconfigure your estimates for the following scenarios:

* Your budget has been reduced from $8,000-$10,000 to a maximum of $6,500. What services will you modify to meet this new budget? Export the updated costs in a CSV file named Reduced_Cost_Estimate.csv and write up a brief narrative of the changes you made in the CSV file below the cost estimate.
* Your budget has been increased to $20,000. What resources will you add and why?
Think about where to add redundancy and how to improve performance. Re-configure your estimate to a monthly invoice of $18K-20K. Export the updated costs to a CSV file named Increased_Cost Estimate.csv and write up a brief narrative of the changes you made in the CSV file below the cost estimate.


### Task 3: Configure Permissions

#### Part 1
In order to complete this task, please ensure your IAM users have been granted access to the billing dashboard (Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console).

1. Update the AWS password policy.
   * Minimum password length = 8
   * Require at least one uppercase letter
   * Require at least one lowercase letter
   * Require at least one number
   * Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
   * Submit a screenshot of the Password Policy from the IAM Account settings page. Name the screenshot udacity_password_policy.png or udacity_password_policy.jpg.
2. Create a Group named CloudTrailAdmins and give it the two CloudTrail privileges.
3. Create a Group named Reviewers and give it the Billing privilege.
4. Configure a user named CloudTrail and a user named Accountant. Give the users AWS Console access and assign them a password that conforms to your password policy. Require them to change their password when they login.
5. Assign CloudTrail to the CloudTrailAdmins group. Assign Accountant to the Reviewers group .
6. Test both user accounts by logging into the AWS console as the users CloudTrail and Accountant after changing their passwords on login. Login using your numerical AccountID
7. While logged-in as the user CloudTrail, go to the CloudTrail page and create a trail named Udacity_Trail. Enable logging on all Read/Writes Management Events and S3 and Lambda events Data Events. Create a new S3 Bucket to store the CloudTrail log. There is no need for advanced configuration.
8. Download the portion of the CloudTrail log that shows the entire Task 3 timeframe and save it as UdacityCloudTrailLog.csv.
9. Before Logging off, return to the CloudTrail configuration page. Disable S3 logging.


### Task 4: Set up Cost Monitoring

#### Part 1
* Configure CloudWatch billing alarm
* Set up a Billing alarm with a $5 threshold
* Set up notification so that you get an email alert when the alarm is triggered.

Save a screenshot of the CloudWatch Alarms page showing the new alarm with a green OK status as CloudWatch_alarm.png or CloudWatch_alarm.jpg


### Task 5: Use Terraform to Provision AWS Infrastructure

#### Part 1
1. Download the [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/cand-c2-project).
2. In the main.tf file write the code to provision
   * AWS as the cloud provider
   * Use an existing VPC ID
   * Use an existing public subnet
   * 4 AWS t2.micro EC2 instances named Udacity T2
   * 2 m4.large EC2 instances named Udacity M4
3. Run Terraform. 
4. Take a screenshot of the 6 EC2 instances in the AWS console and save it as `Terraform_1_1`. 
5. Use Terraform to  delete the 2 m4.large instances 
6. Take an updated screenshot of the AWS console showing only the 4 t2.micro instances and save it as `Terraform_1_2`

#### Part 2
1. In the  Exercise_2 folder, write the code to deploy an AWS Lambda Function using Terraform. Your code should include:

   * A lambda.py file
   * A main.tf file with AWS as the provider, and IAM role for Lambda, a VPC, and a public subnet
   * An outputs.tf file
   * A variables.tf file with an AWS region
  
2. Take a screenshot of the EC2 instances page
3. Take a screenshot of the VPC page
